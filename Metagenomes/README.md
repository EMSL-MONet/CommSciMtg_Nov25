## Data Access

### Learning Objective
1. Metagenomics: Promises and caveats (February 4th).
   This short presentation will discuss the following topics:
   - Capability and limitation of metagenome analysis
   - Information accessible through the EMSL Data Portal/JGI metagenome pipeline
   - Alternate approach of metagenome analysis (i.e., intro to KBase)
     
2. The hands-on session will cover metagenome analysis using the KBase pipeline. 

### Before The Day
Please take a look at the Prerequisites section. 

### On The Day
Feb 6th

Bring your laptop. We (Ellen and Young) will provide the link to the KBase narrative (pipeline). The narrative contains the FASTQ files from NEON samples, which we will work with.

## Agenda on contents of the workshop
The steps of the metagenomics analysis covered in the KBase narrative are similar to those used in the JGI pipeline. During the hands-on workshop, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of these processes and the types of data retrieved from them.
