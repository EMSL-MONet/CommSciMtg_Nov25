## Data Access

### Learning Objective
1. Metagenomics: Promises and caveats (February 4th, morning session).
   This short presentation will discuss the following topics:
   - Capability and limitation of metagenome analysis
   - Information accessible through the EMSL Data Portal/JGI metagenome pipeline
   - Alternate approach of metagenome analysis (i.e., intro to KBase)
     
2. Intro to KBase (February 4th, afternoon session).
   - Overview of the KBase platform (e.g., what is KBase, preparing data for KBase, setting up KBase account).
     
3. The hands-on session (Feb 6th).
   - We will cover metagenome analysis using the KBase pipeline.
   - Overview of metagenome processing from raw reads to binning
   - Explanations on the example data used.
     

### Before The Day
Please take a look at the Prerequisites section. 

### On The Day
Feb 6th

Bring your laptop. We (Ellen and Young) will provide the link to the KBase Narrative (pipeline). The Narrative contains the FASTQ files from NEON samples, which we will work with.

## Agenda on contents of the workshop
The steps of the metagenomics analysis covered in the KBase Narrative are similar to those used in the JGI pipeline. During the hands-on workshop, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of these processes and the types of data retrieved from them.
