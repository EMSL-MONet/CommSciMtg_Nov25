# FT-ICR-MS

## Workshop Session
What: Session 4: In-Person Training   <br>
When: Thursday February 6: 8:30am â€“ 10:40 am, or  10:50 am - 12 noon <br>
Where:  EMSL 1075, Breakout Room 3

- Vanessa Garayburu-Caruso | Earth Scientist
- Kaizad Patel | Earth Scientist
- Will Kew | Chemist

## Know Before You Go
This in-person training session is intended to allow participants to become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data, common visualizations and data usage. The material will be presented using an R markdown script designed for novice users. Participants should make every effort to utilize the scripts provided in order to get the most out of the session, even they are more familiar with another scripting language.

There are two scripts in this tutorial:
1. script 1: introduces users to basic concepts and exploration of FT-ICR-MS data. This will be done using data from 4 samples, included in the .zip file
2. script 2: provides further applications for FT-ICR-data, like correlating with additional soil data. For this, users must download data from the [MONet data portal](https://sc-data.emsl.pnnl.gov/monet). 

Users may open the .html files to view the final rendered reports, which contain code + text + output graphs.  
The corresponding .Rmd are the Rmarkdown files that were used to generate these reports. 

## Prerequistes
Users must download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) before the meeting.

## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands on session are located in this .zip file: [`fticr_tutorial.zip`](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/blob/main/FTICR-MS/fticr_tutorial.zip)

## Learning Objective
After completing this in-person training, you will be able to:

- Load and inspect FT-ICR-MS data using R Markdown
- Run code within R Markdown to create FT-ICR-MS visualizations
- Calculate molecular properties and make common plots of data (van krevelen, DBE, aromaticity, elemental compositions, class compositions)
- Correlate FT-ICR-MS molecular properties with measured soil properties
- Become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data and visualizations

## Before The Day
1. If you don't already have R/RStudio, please download and install here:
    - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)

2. Download [`fticr_tutorial.zip`](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/blob/main/FTICR-MS/fticr_tutorial.zip), which contains both tutorial scripts and data for script1.
3. Download the Processed and merged MONet FT-ICR-MS for this session from Google Drive?  <br>

## On The Day
Bring your computer.  <br>
Have R and R Studio installed. <br>
Have datafiles downloaded in a known location on your computer. <br>
Be ready to learn, network and have fun! <br>

## After The Day 
Enjoy data exploration! Reach out to other participants and EMSL staff with questions and for collaborations. Be sure to write up and publish your findings!
