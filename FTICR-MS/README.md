# FTICR MS

## Workshop Session
What: Session 4: In-Person Training   <br>
When: Thursday February 6th: 8:30am – 10:40 am, or  10:50 am - 12 noon <br>
Where:  EMSL 1077, Breakout Room 3

•	Vanessa Garayburu-Caruso | Earth Scientist  <br>
•	Kaizad Patel | Earth Scientist  <br>
•	Will Kew |Chemist <br>


## Know Before You Go
This in-person training session is intended to allow participants to become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data, common visualizations and data usage. The material will be presented using an R markdown script designed for novice users. Participants should make every effort to utilize the scripts provided in order to get the most out of the session, even they are more familiar with another scripting language.

## Prerequistes
Download R and R studio

## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands on session are located in this repository: https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/tree/main/FTICR-MS

### Learning Objective
After completing this hands on session, you will be able to:

•	Load and inspect FT-ICR-MS data using Jupyter Notebook <br>
•	Run code within Jupyter Notebook to execute Python code and render FTICRMS visualizations <br>
•	Calculate molecular properties and make common plots of data (van krevelen, DBE, aromaticity, elemental compositions, class compositions) <br>
•	Correlate FT-ICR-MS molecular properties with measured soil properties <br>
•	Become familiar with FTICRMS data and visualizations <br>

### Before The Day
1. If you do not already have python and jupyter notebook, please install here:  <br>
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/  <br>
jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/install  <br>

2. Download the FTICRMS folder for this session from GitHUb including:  <br>
•	Jupyter Notebook file: "MONet_HandsOnSession.ipynb" <br>
•	Test file "HelloWorld_test.ipynb" <br>
•	Datafiles:  <br>
"icr.reps.combined_v1_clean.csv" (1000Soils Pilot FT-ICR-MS data) <br>
"Summary_Merged_ZenodoShinyAp.csv" (Summary file) <br>

3. Open your command prompt and install the necessary libraries we will be using. For each library, type the following into the command prompt:<br>
   pip install pandas <br>
   pip install numpy<br>
   pip install matplotlib <br>
   pip install scipy <br>
   pip install seaborn <br>
   pip install tqdm  

You may need to run 'pip3' instead of 'pip' depending on how your Python install is set up.    

4. Run the test file script "HelloWorld_test.ipynb". This will import functions you will need during the hands on session.  <br>
If you have any trouble or do not see a “Congratulations, you are ready for the hands on session on Nov 8”, please
contact Will Kew (william.kew@pnnl.gov), Cheng Shi (cheng.shi@pnnl.gov) or Nicole DiDonato (nicole.didonato@pnnl.gov) with any issues or questions.

### On The Day
Bring your computer.  <br>
Have a python installed and jupyter notebook running. <br>
Have datafiles downloaded in a known location on your computer. <br>
Be ready to learn, network and have fun! <br>
### After The Day 
Enjoy data exploration! Reach out to other participants and EMSL staff with questions and for collaborations. Be sure to write up and publish your findings!
