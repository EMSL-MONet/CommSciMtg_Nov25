Where:  EMSL 1075, Breakout Room 3

•	Vanessa Garayburu-Caruso | Earth Scientist  <br>
•	Kaizad Patel | Earth Scientist  <br>
•	Will Kew |Chemist <br>

## Know Before You Go
This in-person training session is intended to allow participants to become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data, common visualizations and data usage. The material will be presented using an R markdown script designed for novice users. Participants should make every effort to utilize the scripts provided in order to get the most out of the session, even they are more familiar with another scripting language.

## Prerequistes
Users must download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) before the meeting.

## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands on session are located in this repository: https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/tree/main/FTICR-MS

### Learning Objective
After completing this in-person training, you will be able to:

•	Load and inspect FT-ICR-MS data using R Markdown <br>
•	Run code within R Markdown to create FT-ICR-MS visualizations <br>
•	Calculate molecular properties and make common plots of data (van krevelen, DBE, aromaticity, elemental compositions, class compositions) <br>
•	Correlate FT-ICR-MS molecular properties with measured soil properties <br>
•	Become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data and visualizations <br>
