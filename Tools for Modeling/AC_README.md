# Tools for Modeling

## Workshop Session
What: Session 4: In-Person Training   <br>
When: Wednesday, February 5th: 1:00 pm ‚Äì 2:30 am, or  2:40 pm - 4:10 pm <br>
Where:  EMSL 1077, Breakout Room 2

‚Ä¢	Arjun Chakrawal | Postdoctoral Researcher   <br>
‚Ä¢	Maruti Mudunuru | Earth Scientist  <br>


## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands-on session are located in this repository: https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/tree/main/Tools%20for%20Modeling
### Learning Objective
- Analyze FTICR data to estimate microbial functional traits, such as maximum growth rate and potential carbon-use efficiency, using the [Lambda model](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.531756/full).
- Apply the metabolic transition theory by fitting a kinetic relation to predict soil respiration rates based on DOM concentration and chemical diversity ([source](https://academic.oup.com/ismej/article/8/8/1747/7582562)).
- Experiment with model parameters to explore their impact and identify the best-fitting values.
- Perform least-square fitting to refine parameter estimates and achieve optimal model performance.


### Before The Day
- Get familiar with thermodynamic modeling. A good place to start is https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.531756/full
- Test a few code blocks in the Google Colab link below to ensure everything‚Äôs working smoothly.
  
### On The Day 
Get Ready for the Colab Session!
- Bring Your Laptop üíª ‚Äì Connected to the internet and ready to go!
- Open the Notebook on Google Colab üåê ‚Äì Log in with your Google account and set up early to avoid delays.
- Test It üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äì Run the first few code blocks to ensure everything‚Äôs working smoothly. If it doesn't run let one of us know. 
- Be Ready to Learn & Have Fun üéâ ‚Äì Let‚Äôs network, learn, and crush it together!


## Agenda on contents of the workshop
- Use Jupyter Notebook deployed on Google Colab to execute the workflow.  **Link to collab JUPYTER NOTEBOOK https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-LIyu8R6NPO6ArY-g0bl4UjsHzpsefqA?usp=sharing**

## What to expect when you attend the workshop:
* Data Exploration: Learn to download and explore the MONet 1000 soil dataset from Zenodo using zenodo_get and Pandas.
* FTICR Data Processing: Process FTICR data to assign chemical classes and calculate diversity metrics.
* Thermodynamic Modeling: Use the thermodynamic theory to estimate microbial traits like substrate uptake rate and carbon use efficiency.
* Soil Respiration Prediction: Apply metabolic transition state theory and MONOD kinetics to predict soil respiration.
* Hands-on Coding: Write and execute Python code in Google Colab and Data Visualization using Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.
