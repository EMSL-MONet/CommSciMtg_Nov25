## Know Before You Go
This in-person training session is intended to provide an over tools. The material for each of these demonstrations is provided within folders and files of this repo. Participants should make every effort to utilize the scripts provided in order to get the most out of the session, even if they are more familiar with another scripting languages.
Please test a few code blocks in the Google Colab link below to ensure everything‚Äôs working smoothly.

## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands-on session are located in this repository: https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/tree/main/Tools%20for%20Modeling

### Learning Objective
After completing this in-person training, you will be able to:
- Load any XCT data into a Python environment
- Extract useful data using built-in modules in Pore2Chip
- Use data to generate a scalable micromodel design

### Before The Day
- Check the readmes beforehand!
- Open the Notebook on Google Colab üåê ‚Äì Log in with your Google account and set up early to avoid delays.
- Test It üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äì Run the first few code blocks to ensure everything‚Äôs working smoothly. If it doesn't run let one of us know. 

### On The Day
- Bring Your Laptop üíª ‚Äì Connected to the internet and ready to go!

## Agenda on contents of the workshop
- Use Jupyter Notebook deployed on Google Colab to execute the workflow.
