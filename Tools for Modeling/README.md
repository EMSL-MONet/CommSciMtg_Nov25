## Know Before You Go
This in-person training session is intended to provide an overview of modeling tool used to analyze key MONet data type specicially FTICR and XCT. The material for each of these demonstrations is provided within three Markdown file links below. Participants should make every effort to utilize the scripts provided in order to get the most out of the session, even if they are more familiar with another scripting languages.
* Demo 1: [Using FTICR data to constrain kinetic model for predicting soil respiration](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/blob/main/Tools%20for%20Modeling/Demo1-Using%20FTICR%20data%20to%20predict%20soil%20respiration.md) <br>
* Demo 2: [Hands-on learning of basic processing, segmentation, and visualization of 3D tomography](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov23/tree/main/XCT)
* Demo 3: [Utilizing Pore2Chip to make a 2D Digital Twin of a Soil XCT Scan](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/blob/main/Tools%20for%20Modeling/Demo2-Utilizing%20Pore2Chip.md)  <br>
* Demo 4: [Performing Numerical Simulations on Example Soil Micromodel](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov25/blob/main/Tools%20for%20Modeling/Demo3-Numerical%20Flow%20Sims.md)

### Learning Objective
After completing this in-person training, you will be able to:

* Analyze FTICR data to estimate microbial functional traits, such as maximum growth rate and carbon-use efficiency, using the Lambda model and metabolic transition theory to predict soil respiration rates based on DOM concentration and diversity.
* Load XCT data into a Python environment, extract useful data using built-in modules in Pore2Chip, and utilize the extracted data to generate scalable micromodel designs for studying soil processes.
* Solve 2D steady-state flow problems in heterogeneous porous media using pore-scale geometries extracted from XCT images.
