## Agenda on contents of the workshop

## What to expect when you attend the workshop:

* Hands-on learning of basic processing, segmentation, and visualization of 3D tomography data using Fiji
* Demo XCT data analysis using Avizo

## What do you need to install, instructions on how to get to the program?

**Install Fiji:**

1. Download and install Fiji, an open-source image analysis software: https://fiji.sc/
2. See the file "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" for details on how to install Fiji.

**Check if Fiji works:**

1. Open the file "Soil core 2 top zoom_500x500x500_8b".
2. See slides 4-7 in "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" for help.

## Tips and troubleshooting

* Please install Fiji ahead of time.
* If you have any problems installing or using Fiji, please see the file "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" or contact the workshop organizers for help.

## Agenda on contents of the workshop

### Learning outcomes of the day:

* Understanding 3D data, its processing and analysis, as well as visualization with an emphasis on the pore structure of soil

### What did we do?

* Opened 3D XCT image data
* Performed basic data processing steps
* Segmented porosity from soil data
* Visualized pore structure

### What can you do on your own?

* All of the steps in this hands-on tutorial can be done on your own

## Other resources

### See Data Tutorial presentation in Session 3: 

* Tutorial 2 - XCT data processing and analysis for insights into soil microstructure
